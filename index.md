Hello. My name is Marcos Garcia, and I am a Computer Science major at Cal State Fullerton. I plan on graduating in the spring of 2028.

## My Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

### Lab 7:
    While it seemed like a pretty straightforward task to do, it did cause a bit of trouble for me and my partner. What was the most difficult part was setting the logic for the conditionals of if parking was available. It was a bit difficult to visualize how the logic worked, like checking to see if the right signs were used to check if the time was right. The most difficult part was implementing the times where they were between the 30 minute mark, and not at the start or end of an hour. It was very satisfying to solve the logic for determining when you can park, which is what made this lab one of my favorites, and memorable to me.

### Lab 8, Part 2:
    I found this lab pretty interesting, as the pattern that resulted in the program was cool. It seemed like it would have been somewhat difficult to do, but following the instructions, with just nested loops, the assignment was actually pretty simple. I did run into a problem that was sort of difficult to solve, since it was based on how many rows there were, which was hard to count. I had to program a debugger that counted how many rows and columns there were, so I could find out where my error was, which was in the logic for the range of the loop, which was something to do with the greater than sign.

### Lab 11, Part 2:
    I find the idea of PRNGâ€™s very interesting, and getting to implement them into a game was pretty fun to me. It was a little bit confusing figuring out how to set up the PRNG, but once we got it working, the computer appeared to make random numbers, which was very cool to me. This lab taught me a bit on how to read code that is not written by me, and trying to figure out how to set up the PRNG was fun.
